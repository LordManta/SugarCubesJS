Reactive Programs:
One adds a program to the SugarCubes clock.
The first one is a filter which scans the kpress sensor to isolate the press of
the escape key an so produce the kpress_esc event if it applies.
The SC.filter() instruction takes 4 parameters :
 - the sensor to scan (Sens_kpress)
 - the event to generate when scan function detects the escape key is pressed
   (Evt_kpress_esc)
 - the scan function which should not produces side effect and return undefined
   if detection fails and a value (that is not used in this example) if
   detection of escape key press succeeds.
   Here, detection relies on the which parameter of standard DOM Keyboard Event.
   The code 27 is used to identify escape key.
 - finally the optional fourth parameter is a number of successive instants
   during which the filter should apply (SC.forever indicates that filtering
   never terminates).

/*
The following program awaits Evt_kpress_esc and then forces a burst reaction
for on more instant (instruction SC.next()). 
Burst reactions also called «reactions» are the execution of one ore more
consecutive instants executed contiguously and atomically form the point of
view of the external environment.
This is a new feature of SugarCubes introduced by Claude Lion.
A Burst reaction is a finite number of consecutive instant and so should always
terminates to preserve the reactivity property of a SugarCubes reaction.
Why one uses that here ?
The reactive machine is paced by the 4 sensors : (i) mouse down, (ii) mouse
move, (iii) mouse up, (iv) and key press.
That means that : each time one of those sensors are triggered, the reactive
machine is triggered.
In the case of Evt_kpress_esc and Sens_mouse_up those two events are part of a
preemption decision. So, the eventual reaction to the preemption is postponed
to the next instant (according to the Boussinot's paradigm). So one uses the
SC.next() to burst one more instant in the same reaction to be sure that the
reaction to the preemption is triggered in time.
