First, one makes a logical clock, which paces execution of the reactive system.

As logical clock executes reactive programs.
One configures it to display a text showing instants elapsing:
1 -: 
2 -: 
3 -: 
4 -:
...
To do so, one uses an HTML pre element, and redirect stdout to that pre
element.

Then, one makes an identifier of a reactive event called "e".
*/

/*
One can use that reactive event to build reactive programs :
 - the first one, in a loop (of 3 iterations) is awaiting for the event e to be
   present and then instantaneously display a message on the stout.
 - the second, in another loop that is pausing for 5 consecutive instants and
   then instantaneously generates the reactive event e.

Note : The repeat loop is not intantaneous, which means that when p terminates,
the repeat instruction do not restart p in that very same instant, but wait for
the next instant before restarting p.

/*
Then, one adds the two programs into the reactive clock. This builds a program,
which is the parallel of the two added programs.
The following two lines of code is equivalent to :
main.addProgram(SC.par(program1, program2));

/*
To get the execution thread, clock needs a processor which will execute
reactions. One uses a periodic sensor which is a SugarCubes sensor that issues
a new value every seconds.
*/
const power=SC.periodic({ delay: 1000 });
/*
One binds the clock to that sensor, so the clock will produce a reaction of the
reactive system everytime the sensor issues a new value.
